## Instructions
You are reviewing code changes for the InterCooperative Network (ICN) project. Your review should focus on:

1. **ICN Invariants Compliance**: Ensure changes align with ICN core principles:
   - Event-sourced architecture
   - Deterministic operations
   - Democratic governance structures
   - Non-transferable coordination credits (CC)
   - No token-bought voting mechanisms

2. **Policy Adherence**: Verify changes comply with ICN policies:
   - File modification permissions
   - Actor authorization levels
   - Scope restrictions

3. **Code Quality**: Standard code review practices:
   - Logic correctness
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications
   - Testing coverage
   - Documentation completeness

## Review Focus Areas
- [ ] Does this maintain event-sourced patterns?
- [ ] Are democratic governance principles preserved?
- [ ] Is proper authorization/policy checking in place?
- [ ] Are there any centralization risks?
- [ ] Is the implementation deterministic?
- [ ] Are tests adequate for the changes?
- [ ] Is documentation updated as needed?

Please provide a detailed review covering these areas and any other concerns.`,
